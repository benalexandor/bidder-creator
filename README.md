Bidder Creator for Publica SSP

The bidder creator for Publica SSP leverages Google Drive and Publica APIs to scrape information and use it to automatically create bidders for NA markets. 

NB: Not all of the functionality for Publica's API has been built out to support this program. We are waiting for Publica to implement the relevant API functions for bidders as opposed to endpoints. As such, the program as it is written uses EP functions while we wait for Bidder capabilities. 

The code found in this repository is an adapted script for endpoint creation.
